# Smart-monitoring-of-covid-patients

Advances in data and correspondence innovations have prompted the rise of Internet of Things (IoT). In the modern health care environment, the usage of IoT technologies brings convenience of physicians and patients since they are applied to various medical areas (for example, real-time monitoring, patient information management, and healthcare management). In proposed framework we present a potential application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare monitoring for pandemic situations. The IoT node tracks health parameters, including body temperature, pulse rate, ECG, room temperature then updates the smartphone app to display the user health conditions. The app notifies the family members/attendees if there is change in values of the readings (vital signs), which is a key factor in preventing abnormal situation of post covid patients. The communication between the IoT node and fog server is done by 4G/Wi-Fi, which can be selected based on environmental constraints. The SMART MONITORING framework can assist in minimizing the post covid patient death exposure risk.
